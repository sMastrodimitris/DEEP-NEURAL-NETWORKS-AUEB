Introduction
Submit a report (pdf or a clean notebook) for the following machine learning project. 
Explain briefly in the report the architectures that you used, how they were trained, tuned, etc. 
Describe challenges and problems and how they were addressed. 
Present in the report your experimental results and demos (e.g., screenshots) showing how your code works. 

Fashion item recognition
Given an image of a fashion item, build a deep learning model that recognizes the fashion item. 
You must use at least 2 different architectures, one with MLPs and one with CNNs. 
Use the Fashion-MNIST dataset to train and evaluate your models.
