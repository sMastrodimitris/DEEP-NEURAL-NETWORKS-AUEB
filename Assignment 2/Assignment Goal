Introduction
Submit a report (pdf or a clean notebook) for the following machine learning project.
Explain briefly in the report the architectures that you used, how they were trained, tuned, etc. 
Describe challenges and problems and how they were addressed. 
Present in the report your experimental results and demos (e.g., screenshots) showing how your code works.

X-Ray classification
Given a study containing X-Ray images, build a deep learning model that decides if the study is normal or abnormal. 
You must use at least 2 different architectures, one with your own CNN model (e.g., you can use a model similar to the CNN of the previous project) 
and one with a popular pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG-19, ResNet, etc.). Use the MURA dataset to train and evaluate your models. 
More information about the task and the dataset can be found at https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/. 
To download the dataset you must fill out a form, so complete this action as soon as possible.
